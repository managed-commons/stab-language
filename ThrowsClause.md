# Checked exceptions #
In Stab the exceptions are not checked at compile-time. However the compiler generates a throws clause in the generated bytecode if a method is decorated with a `stab.lang.Throws` annotation.

It is useful for Java interoperability.
For example
```
using java.io;
using stab.lang;
class C {
    [Throws({ typeof(IOException) })]
    public int test(Reader r) {
        return r.read();
    }
}
```
makes it possible to catch the `IOException` in a Java program. Without the annotation it is not be possible to surround the call to the method with a try/catch statement.
